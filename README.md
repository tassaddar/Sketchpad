This is a siple sketchpad application allowing you to trace the cursor with a line of random color.
The default grid size is 16x16, it appears as the page is fully loaded.

Currently there is no limit to the grid size, it will simply be extremely slow on huge grids so choose the size carefully (as described in the prompt when resizing).

Have fun :)
